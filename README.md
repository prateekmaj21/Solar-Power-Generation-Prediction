# Solar-Power-Generation-Prediction
Solar Power Generation Prediction Based on Entire Data of 2006 in Alabama, US.

This project focuses on predicting power generation using various machine learning models, including a Neural Network, Random Forest, and Prophet.  It analyzes historical power generation data, incorporates weather data (where available), and provides forecasts.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following sections:

1. **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaning, handling missing values, and preparing the dataset for model training.
2. **Neural Network Model:**  Predicting power generation using a feedforward neural network.
3. **Time Series Analysis with Prophet:** Forecasting power generation using the Prophet model.
4. **Model Evaluation:** Assessing the performance of each model using appropriate metrics.
5. **Visualization:** Plotting model results, including training history and predictions.
6. **Recommendations:**  Practical recommendations based on the model's insights.

## Key Features

* **Multiple Model Approaches:**  Uses a combination of models (neural network, Prophet) to leverage the strengths of different algorithms for time series data and regression tasks.
* **Data Scaling:**  Implements data scaling (MinMaxScaler) to enhance model performance.
* **Metrics:**  Employs various metrics (MSE, RMSE, R-squared, MAE) for model evaluation.
* **Visualization:** Provides clear visualizations of model training history and predictions.
* **Hyperparameter Tuning:**  (Optional) Includes potential for hyperparameter tuning to further improve model accuracy.


## Getting Started

1. **Dependencies:**
   Install required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas matplotlib scikit-learn tensorflow prophet meteostat shap
   ```

2. **Data:**
   The project requires a dataset of historical power generation data, potentially including features like time, weather data, and other relevant parameters. You would need to place the data in the working directory or modify the code to point to the correct data path.

3. **Run the Notebook:**  Execute the Jupyter Notebook or Python script.


## Model Details

### Neural Network

The neural network model is designed to capture complex non-linear relationships in the data, which could be beneficial if there are intricate interactions between features. The notebook explains the scaling, architecture, training process, and evaluation of the neural network.


### Time Series Analysis (Prophet)

Prophet excels at time series forecasting, handling seasonality and trends well.  The notebook demonstrates data preparation, model fitting, prediction, and evaluation using Prophet. Includes handling seasonality effectively and making adjustments for daily and yearly patterns.


## Results and Evaluation

The project includes detailed evaluations of the different models, presenting their strengths and weaknesses. Metrics like Mean Absolute Error, Mean Squared Error, Root Mean Squared Error, and R-squared are calculated and analyzed.

## Future Improvements

* **Feature Engineering**:  Explore adding more relevant features (weather, solar irradiance, equipment health, etc.) that might improve model performance.
* **Hyperparameter Optimization**: Implement a more systematic approach to hyperparameter tuning using techniques like grid search or random search.
* **Model Ensembling**: Combine predictions from the different models to potentially improve accuracy and robustness.


## Recommendations

The project provides recommendations for optimizing the power generation system, including solar panel optimization, energy storage strategies, and predictive maintenance strategies.
